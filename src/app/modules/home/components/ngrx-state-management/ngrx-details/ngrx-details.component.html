<p>This section will talk about how I use NGRX in this application.<br>
    I break it down to the following 5 parts:
</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>State</td>
            <td>This is where the information is stored for a given feature.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Actions</td>
            <td>These are the actions that can be performed on the state.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Effects</td>
            <td>
                I like to think of these as event handlers for performing actions on state data.<br><br>
                These are injectable classes which handle the actions that require more than just a simple state update.
                When the action is complete they will trigger the appropriate action for the reducer to handle.<br>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reducers</td>
            <td>
                I like to think of these as event handlers for updating the state.<br><br>
                These objects handle the actions which change the state.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Selectors</td>
            <td>
                These are functions which return a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization"
                   target="_blank">memoized</a> selector containing a subset of the state.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
