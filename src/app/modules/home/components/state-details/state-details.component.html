<app-title3>State</app-title3>
<p>
   The state holds specific data and actions for any given feature. In this application, I have 1 feature which uses
   this archeture,
   the bowling feature.
</p>
<p>
   You will also see a common folder. This contains the state-event class, state-event.ts, used by the feature's
   service to dispatch the assigned action.<br>
   Either the effect, reducer, or both will be called which are subscribed to the action.
