<app-title2>NGRX Data Flow</app-title2>

<p>Using ngrx for state management coupled with services which exposes the state so I don't have to inject multiple
   states into any one component I can achieve a state in one location.
   Unit testing a component with multiple states injected is a pain.
</p>

<p>Each component will inject the service associated with the state it needs.
   The service will expose actions as events and selectors as observables.
   If a component requires data from multple states then that component will inject multiple services.
