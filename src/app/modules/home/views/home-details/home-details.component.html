   Welcome to my Angular project.
</app-title2>
<p>
   Hello and welcome to a fun little project which grows with each new Angular functionality I learn.
   I am a big fan of Angular and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.
</p>
<p>
   What I hope you will find here is a good example of how to use Angular in a real world application.
   Look at the architecture and let me know what you think.
   Feel free to fork the repository and enjoy Angular with me.

   Books

<p>
   The books app is a simple example of how to use Angular call an external API and manipulate the state.
   It calls the Google Books API, <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes</a>,
   to search for books and display the results.
   The state is used to store the search results as well as store the collection.
   The books app also uses the Angular Material library to create a nice user interface.
